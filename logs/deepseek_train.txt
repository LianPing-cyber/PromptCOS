**********0**********
Qwen2Model is using Qwen2SdpaAttention, but `torch.nn.functional.scaled_dot_product_attention` does not support `output_attentions=True`. Falling back to the manual attention implementation, but specifying the manual implementation will be required from Transformers version v5.0.0 onwards. This warning can be removed using the argument `attn_implementation="eager"` when loading the model.
The attention layers in this model are transitioning from computing the RoPE embeddings internally through `position_ids` (2D tensor with the indexes of the tokens), to using externally computed `position_embeddings` (Tuple of tensors, containing cos and sin). In v4.46 `position_ids` will be removed and `position_embeddings` will be mandatory.
